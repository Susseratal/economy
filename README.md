This is a basic C# version of the economic model I'm trying to set up in the game I'm currently working on

IMPOTENT:  
this version is wrong - here, I was ill advisedly trying to simulate an economy in the sense of a country with businesses acting upon it - what I actually want to be simulating is the effects of supply and demand on individual settlements - I will be correcting this to fit that description and then I'll write a proper readme
