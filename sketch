company:
has income vs costs
makes 1 product
product has price, supply, demand, production rate, production cost
supply/demand deterimes price
production rate determines supply
income determines production rate
price vs production cost determines income

companies sell to locations

location:
has multiple products, small income from markup
has local supply for all products
each product has:
supply/demand/(price: cost of purchase *1.15)/cost of purchase

locations buy from companies, which is how locations increase their supply, and do so based on the local demand
this determines the demand on the companies, who then use that to set their prices
the supply of companies comes from their production, which depends on their income (or could be static)
